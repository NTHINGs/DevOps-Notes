# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

In short, it lays out some practices to follow in order for the code you write to more quickly and safely get to your users and ultimately generate value.

## CI

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

## CD

Continuous deployment is a strategy for software releases where in any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the softwareâ€™s users.
